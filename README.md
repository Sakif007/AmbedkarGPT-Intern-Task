# AmbedkarGPT-Intern-Task
AmbedkarGPT is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built to answer questions over Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s writings, featuring multi-document retrieval, rigorous evaluation metrics, and comparative chunking analysis.

The project combines dense document retrieval, local LLM inference, and rigorous evaluation metrics to analyze both retrieval effectiveness and answer quality.

# Purpose of the Project
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but prone to hallucination when answering factual questions.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by grounding model outputs in retrieved source documents.

This project aims to:

Build a multi-document RAG pipeline

Evaluate retrieval quality and answer quality quantitatively

Analyze how chunk size affects performance

Identify failure modes in retrieval and generation

Recommend an optimal configuration based on empirical results
